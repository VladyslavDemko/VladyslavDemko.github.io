<h2>The Coffee Conspiracy</h2>
<div> id="middle">
<p>Coffee. Nowadays it's everywhere, but it wasn't always like this. Only a few decades back tea, in fact, was the beverage of choice amongst the commonfolk. One has to then question himself, why tea is considered posh in the modern age. To those inclined to seek out the truth, however, it is as crystal clear as a cup of water. The secret of the drink popularised during the so called "Enlightenment Age" lies in its mind altering properties. The corrupt elites masterminded a plan to control the minds of the populus through the great minds of the generation, setting people like Newton as a prime example of an upstanding citizen. 
  And so the decades long gamble has paid off. The mind controlled masses march on, their bodies pushed to the limit, sleep replaced by the black mixture, as black as death itself. </p>
